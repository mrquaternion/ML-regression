# Weather Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project analyzes weather data from Australia, focusing on temperature patterns in Canberra. It uses various data analysis and machine learning techniques to process, visualize, and model the temperature trends. The only purpose of this project was to understand the basis of data science. 

## Data Source
The project uses the "weatherAUS.csv" dataset, which contains weather information for various locations in Australia. The dataset was retrieved from Kaggle. It is an extended version of https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package.

## Features
1. Data Loading and Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Visualization
3. Polynomial Regression Analysis
4. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) Optimization
5. Model Comparison and Evaluation

## Technical Stack
- Python
- Libraries: TensorFlow, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib

### Visualization
- Plots average temperature over time
- Visualizes temperature trends for specific time periods

### Modeling
1. Polynomial Regression using Matrix Multiplication
   - Implements a basic polynomial regression model
   
2. Polynomial Regression with SGD and Regularization
   - Uses TensorFlow for model implementation
   - Applies Stochastic Gradient Descent for optimization
   - Incorporates regularization to prevent overfitting

### Analysis
- Compares different modeling approaches
- Evaluates model performance using R-squared values
- Analyzes residuals to assess model fit

## Future ameliorations (updated)
If this project were to be redone from the ground up, several improvements would be included before applying the regression model. Initially, I would conduct thorough data processing, addressing outliers with various methods. Additionally, I would implement feature selection to optimize the model's performance.
